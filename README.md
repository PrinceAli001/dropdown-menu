# dropdown-menu
Trying my hands at a dropdown menu
This package has been published as an npm public package
The function is used to create a dropdown

Example:
hideAndReveal(parent:parents,child:children,element:background,pictureOne:imgOne,pictureTwo:imgTwo);

The parent parameter in this case can be what those three dots or three lines was placed inside
The code checks if the three lines or dots(or whatever you choose to use) is the current image in the parent
If the above statement is true then the element parameter changes it's display to block and the three lines or dots(pictureOne) gets
changed to a closing image(pictureTwo).
